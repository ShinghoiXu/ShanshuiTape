## Get Started

To start this program, you need certain software and libraries down below:
+ [Processing](https://processing.org/) as the IDE
+ [Minim](https://github.com/ddf/Minim)

### Prepare a music file
After installing all the libraries, we need a .mp3 file in the folder to run this program.
We need to name it as "music.mp3".

+ Change the color
## Special Thanks
Special thanks to all kinds of open source codes online, including the environment and libraries mentioned above. Besides, I also want to thank Daniel Shiffman's great book [*The Nature of Code*](https://natureofcode.com/). His code helps me draw fractal trees.
